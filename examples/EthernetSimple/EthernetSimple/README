INTRODUCTION

EthernetSimple is a small ArcCore project of how to use Ethernet belongings 
and Communication clusters in an ArcCore solution environment using 
LWIP TCP/IP stack that has been developed by Adam Dunkels (CNA) at the 
Swedish Institute of Computer Science.

The focus of the project is to 
   # use an ASR application over RTE to communicate over Ethernet cluster (UDP)
   # use DLT (TCP)
   # use DoIP (TCP) - Temporarily unavailable due to migration of stack to higher AUTOSAR version
   # use XCP over IP (TCP and UDP)
   # use stress test and measure throughput 
   
   

   Also this project internally at ArcCore used for    
Integration/Breakdown/release verification tests


How to use:
   Required : an UDP tool (ask for it) or use over own tool
              FBENCH tool for the throughput measurement (http://fnet.sourceforge.net/manual/quick_start_benchmark.html )
   
   Compile the corresponding project depending up on the MCU you have,
   Currently the project is supported for Zc702(Zynq), MPC5777M ,STM3210C, Jacinto6 MPC5777C and MPC5748G boards
   
   Connect the Ethernet Cable to your PC which is configured with a static IP address,
   Configure as 192.168.0.5 to match existing configuration of the project    
   
   
   Open windows command processor and Send ping command (over ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol) 
   to the configured board IP address 192.168.0.10. 
   192.168.0.10 should be able to echo back for the ping commands.
   This verifies shortly Ethernet connection and Ethernet MCAL configuration inside the project.
   
   Open the UDP tool Set the Target IP address to 192.168.0.10, set the port as 1234, neglect SA and TA.
   Write non zero 4 byte in the Message box ex: 12345678 (tool takes it as hex Value directly) and 
   now the board should be able to echo back with same message continuosly (in  Received box).
   Write a Zero value (at least 2 digits) in Message box ex: 00 and the board now on should be able 
   to send 4 byte ADC value in Received Message box continuosly until you send again a non zero byte Message.
   This verifies whole sequence of using RTE application over UDP.
   LED1 will toggle on any change of command is received at the board side
   LED2 will toggle on any output on the board side.
   
   To use DLT, Open the DLT Viewer and configure to use it via TCP (use the address 192.168.0.10 and the port as 999) and connect
   DLTviewer should be able connect and receives continuos demo message from an SWC
   
   Set the Target IP address to 192.168.0.10,Configure SA box in the tool as 0e80, TA box as 1001, Port as 13400.
   And send Diagnosis commands over TCP and the board should be able to respond back accordingly.
   UDP tool is sometimes not able to capture consecutive TCP responses depending on the timing. 
   Verify on any other Ethernet packet capture tool.
      
   Ex:
   
    Activate routing request by RouteActivation box and send TCP message
     (or) this command 02fd0005000000070e800000
   
    Send a DOIP command  02fd8001000000060e8010011001
       1Response should be  02fd80020000000510010e8000
       2Response should be  02fd800100000006100100005001                             
      
    DIDs 0x0101,0x0102, 0x0103 are configured to read from an application callouts.   
       Send a DOIP command  02fd8001000000070e801001220101 
       1Response should be  02fd80020000000510010e8000
       2Response should be  02fd80010000000b1001000062010101020304
       
       Send correspondingly 02fd8001000000070e801001220102 and 02fd8001000000070e801001220103 same way.
         
   This confirms shortly DCM, DOIP and TCP connections 
   
   Set the Target IP address to 192.168.0.10,configure port as 13400 (neglect SA and TA.), send XCP commands.
   And Board should be able to respond back accordingly.
   This Confirms shortly XCP over IP. 
   XCP test is not available for STM3210C board due to lack of RAM.  
   
   
   Throughput/Stress test - TCP Sending
   
   Download FBENCH tool 
   Open FBENCH tool, use TCP IPV4 Sending (TCP client - sending data)
   configure Remote IP address as "192.168.0.10", Remote Port as "111", 
   set the number of iterations minimum 25 for the best calculation
   And try to measure the throughput, throughput should ideally be starting from variable 20-50 Mbps for the current board settings
   except for MPC board which has low bandwidth configuration 
   
   
Notice: Diagnosis Test over TCP is currently not available since DoIP module the system made obsolete since the migration of the
        stack from AUTOSAR 4.0.3 version to 4.2.X version
        If you get in to Ethernet link problems with the test PC, please try to check if DET error Id TCPIP_E_ARC_TRCV_INIT_STATE_FAILED 
        in TCPIP module is set and try verifying your connection set up.
