This exmaple show how to build the BSW and RTE as a library that can be distributed and linked together with
an application i.e. HelloWorld_App


IMPORTANT NOTE!!
Containers holding a parameter with the property "Symbolic Name Value" set to true must have the same shortname
for all mcals. E.g. There should be a CanController with shortname "CanController0" for all mcals.
This is required to be able to share non-mcal modules.
