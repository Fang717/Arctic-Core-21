This page describes generic information that is applicable for all AUTOSAR ADC modules when developed according to the standard e.g. buffer layout.

The ADC is developed according to ASR Specification of ADC driver according to ASR 4.3.0 The ADC module initializes and controls the internal Analogue Digital Converter Unit(s) of the microcontroller. It provides services to start and stop a conversion respectively to enable and disable the trigger source for a conversion. Furthermore it provides services to enable and disable a notification mechanism and routines to query the status and result of a conversion.

The ADC Driver can consist of several more or less independent hardware units (AdcHwUnit). Each hardware Unit includes all parts necessary to perform an analogue to digital conversion.

For each hardware unit one or more ADCChannelGroup can be configured. Each group is a sub container to a AdcHWUnit and can be seen as part of the unit. 
Each ADCChannelGroup refers to one or many ADCChannel which represents a logical ADC entity bound to one port pin. The channels are also subcontainers to the AdcHwUnit may be referred in several AdcChannelGroups. All interfaces within the ADC module uses AdcChannelGroups e.g. for starting conversions. The conversion of the whole ADCChannelGroup  is triggered by one source and there are two types of sources (hardware trigger and software triggers). The ADC channels within the group are then converted one after another and the result saved in a buffer.

The hardware units always work on groups and never on individual channels. If you want to sample just one channel you put that channel in a group with only one member.

MCAL specifc implementation 
---------------------------------

An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is an electronic system that converts an analog signal into a digital signal such that the converted data can be processed by the central processing unit.  The input analog signal has to be sampled with a frequency at least higher than twice the highest frequency of the signal, then a digital representation of the analog signal, which is a binary sequence code, is produced after the sampled signal (a certain voltage value, a certain current value, etc) being processed by the converting circuit within the ADC. An important concept of ADC is the resolution, which indicates the number of discrete values it can produce over the range of analog values. For example, an ADC with a resolution of 8 bits can encode an analog input to one in 256 different levels, since 28 = 256. If an analog signal with a range 0-16 V is converted to digital value by this 8-bit resolution ADC, each digit will represent 16/256 = 0.0625 V, e.g. 00110101 represents roughly 3.3 V.
