Introduction
================

This is a design description of the Arccore MCAL.
This document specifies the functionality, API and the configuration of the AUTOSAR BSW MCU .
This driver specification is applicable for on-chip MCU.






Static design aspects of the software units
==================================================



Software structure including its hierarchical levels

Data types and their characteristics
----------------------------------------
The MCU has its own type definitions and also uses imported types.
The imported types and its own type are described in chapter 8 "API Specification " of AUTOSAR requirements, Specifications of MCU Driver, ID: 031.


External interfaces of the software units
------------------------------------------------
Detailed information of APIs is described in chapter 8 "API Specification" of AUTOSAR requirements, Specifications of MCU Driver, ID: 031.


Constraints including the scope of the architecture and external dependencies
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Most of the parts are generic since the header file defines the registers.
 * The Mcu.c file contains the generic implementation of all the API mentioned in MCU driver SWS document (ASR 4.3.0)
 * The hardware specific implementations are done in Mcu_Hw_* .c file (depends on the architecture).
 * Each API will have the Det error check mentioned in MCU driver SWS document and will call the hardware specific implementation function if the check passes.
 * The legacy drivers in Arccore used to be one .c file for each driver. 
 * Improvements/bugs then affected one driver for each MCAL.
 * That was not very maintainable and there is always a risk that something is missed.
 * So it was decided to divide driver two different parts, one generic and one MCAL specific.
